# Mastering Dynamic Programming: A Comprehensive Guide
Dynamic programming is a powerful technique in computer science and mathematics that involves breaking down a problem into smaller subproblems and solving each subproblem only once, storing the solutions to subproblems in a table to avoid redundant computations. It is commonly used to solve optimization problems.
## Understanding the Basics
- Learn the [basic concepts](https://stackoverflow.blog/2022/01/31/the-complete-beginners-guide-to-dynamic-programming/) and principles behind dynamic programming.
- Understand the [overlapping subproblems](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/overlapping-subproblems-property-in-dynamic-programming-dp-1/) and [optimal substructure properties](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/optimal-substructure-property-in-dynamic-programming-dp-2/).
